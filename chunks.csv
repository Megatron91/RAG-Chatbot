"Artificial intelligence AI, in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs. Highprofile applications of AI include advanced web search engines e.g., Google Search recommendation systems used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix virtual assistants e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa autonomous vehicles e.g., Waymo generative and creative tools e.g., ChatGPT and AI art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games e.g., chess and Go. However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled AI anymore. Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligencethe ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal levelis among the fields longterm goals."
"To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the early 2020s many billions of dollars were being invested in AI and the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the AI boom. The emergence of advanced generative AI in the midst of the AI boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the risks of AI and its longterm effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Goals  The general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems."
"These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. Reasoning and problemsolving  Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics. Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. Knowledge representation  Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about realworld facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in contentbased indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases, and other areas. A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge."
"Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects situations, events, states, and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous and the subsymbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally. There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. Planning and decisionmaking  An agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. In automated decisionmaking, the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it."
"For each possible action, it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility. In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. In most realworld problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic. It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. In some problems, the agents preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning, or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action."
"A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated e.g., by iteration, be heuristic, or it can be learned. Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. Learning  Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. It has been a part of AI from the beginning. There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input. In reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good. Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning."
"Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity how much data is required, or by other notions of optimization. Natural language processing  Natural language processing NLP allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English. Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering. Early work, based on Noam Chomskys generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with wordsense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called microworlds due to the common sense knowledge problem. Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning, transformers a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism, and others. In 2019, generative pretrained transformer or GPT language models began to generate coherent text, and by 2023, these models were able to get humanlevel scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other realworld applications. Perception  Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world."
"Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. The field includes speech recognition, image classification, facial recognition, object recognition,object tracking, and robotic perception. Social intelligence  Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood. For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction. However, this tends to give nave users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject. General intelligence  A machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence. Techniques  AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above. Search and optimization  AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. There are two very different kinds of search used in AI state space search and local search. State space search  State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state."
"For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called meansends analysis. Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. Heuristics or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. Adversarial search is used for gameplaying programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. Local search  Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks, through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation."
"Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails. Logic  Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation. Formal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and, or, not and implies and predicate logic which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as Every X is a Y and There are some Xs that are Ys. Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises. Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules. Given a problem and a set of premises, problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem."
"In the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic, resolution is a single, axiomfree rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. Inference in both Horn clause logic and firstorder logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages. Fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true. Nonmonotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning. Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning  Many problems in AI including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory."
"These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design. Bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning using the Bayesian inference algorithm, learning using the expectationmaximization algorithm, planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic Bayesian networks. Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters. Classifiers and statistical learning methods  The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types classifiers e.g., if shiny then diamond, on one hand, and controllers e.g., if diamond then pick up, on the other hand. Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be finetuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern also called an observation is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. There are many kinds of classifiers in use. The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm."
"Knearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine SVM displaced knearest neighbor in the 1990s. The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at Google, due in part to its scalability. Neural networks are also used as classifiers. Artificial neural networks  An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function."
"In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows shortterm memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks. Perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons deep learning uses multiple layers. Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are close to each otherthis is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an edge before the network can identify an object. Deep learning  Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the networks inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higherlevel features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces. Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification, and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023. The sudden success of deep learning in 20122015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s but because of two factors the incredible increase in computer power including the hundredfold increase in speed by switching to GPUs and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet."
"GPT  Generative pretrained transformers GPT are large language models LLMs that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Textbased GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation. Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate humanlike text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback RLHF. Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called hallucinations, although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data. They are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. Current models and services include Gemini formerly Bard, ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot, and LLaMA. Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data modalities such as images, videos, sound, and text. Hardware and software  In the late 2010s, graphics processing units GPUs that were increasingly designed with AIspecific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit CPUs as the dominant means for largescale commercial and academic machine learning models training."
"Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research, but generalpurpose programming languages like Python have become predominant. The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 monthsa trend known as Moores law, named after the Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, who first identified it. Improvements in GPUs have been even faster, a trend sometimes called Huangs law, named after Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang. Applications  AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including search engines such as Google Search, targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon, driving internet traffic, targeted advertising AdSense, Facebook, virtual assistants such as Siri or Alexa, autonomous vehicles including drones, ADAS and selfdriving cars, automatic language translation Microsoft Translator, Google Translate, facial recognition Apples Face ID or Microsofts DeepFace and Googles FaceNet and image labeling used by Facebook, Apples iPhoto and TikTok. The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer CAO. Health and medicine  The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients."
"For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 2021 demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein. In 2023, it was reported that AIguided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drugresistant bacteria. In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinsons disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alphasynuclein the protein that characterises Parkinsons disease. They were able to speed up the initial screening process tenfold and reduce the cost by a thousandfold. Games  Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AIs most advanced techniques. Deep Blue became the first computer chessplaying system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997. In 2011, in a Jeopardy!"
"quiz show exhibition match, IBMs question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin. In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Goplaying system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world. Other programs handle imperfectinformation games, such as the pokerplaying program Pluribus. DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. In 2019, DeepMinds AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging realtime strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the worlds best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen openworld video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions. Mathematics  Large language models, such as GPT4, Gemini, Claude, LLaMa or Mistral, are increasingly used in mathematics."
"These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised finetuning or trained classifiers with humanannotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections. A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data. One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result. In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStarMath that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and stepbystep reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen7B to solve 53 of the AIME 2024 and 90 of the MATH benchmark problems. Alternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and AlphaProof all from Google DeepMind, Llemma from EleutherAI or Julius. When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks."
"Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics. Topological deep learning integrates various topological approaches. Finance  Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated robot advisers have been in use for some years. World Pensions experts like Nicolas Firzli insist it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AIinformed financial products and services the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but Im not sure it will unleash a new wave of e.g., sophisticated pension innovation. Military  Various countries are deploying AI military applications. The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams."
"AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine. Generative AI   Agents  Artificial intelligent AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, gameplaying systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In realworld applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decisionmaking and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks. Sexuality  Applications of AI in this domain include AIenabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction, AIintegrated sex toys e.g., teledildonics, AIgenerated sexual education content, and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners e.g., Replika. AI is also used for the production of nonconsensual deepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns."
"AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online genderbased violence and online sexual grooming of minors. Other industryspecific tasks  There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated AI in some offerings or processes. A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Further, AI can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions. In agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights."
"For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, realtime science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. During the 2024 Indian elections, US50 millions was spent on authorized AIgenerated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied including sometimes deceased politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages. Ethics  AI has potential benefits and potential risks. AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else. However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. Inproduction systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning. Risks and harm   Privacy and copyright  Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright. AIpowered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns"
